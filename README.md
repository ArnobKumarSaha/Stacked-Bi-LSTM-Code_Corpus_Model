In this work, we propose a Bangla sentiment analysis method by incorporating a word2vec model and a stacked bidirectional LSTM model. We first employ the word2vec model to capture semantic features of words and transfer words into high-dimensional word vectors. Two types of word2vec models: continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and skip-gram were selected to evaluate the mode.   We then use the Stacked Bi-LSTM model to conduct the feature extraction of sequential word vectors. Next ,  We apply a binary softmax classifier to predict the sentiment orientation by using semantic and contextual features.
